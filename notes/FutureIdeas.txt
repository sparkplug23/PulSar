#Idea 001 (v1+)
    ESP32 wifi support fully, with the same saving/SPIFFS etc 

#Idea 002 (v1+)
    ESP32 POE/ethernet

#Idea 003 (v<1)
    Night Mode = For lights with dimmers, optional lower settings during night hours
    #Idea 003.2 (prev. #41)
        Tweak scenes that use time_on, or mode_one_time_on? (maybe not)
        Enable bi-scene modes, including the mqtt for it
        This will be used first for landing light, brighter then dims to standby colour (ie dim)
        Same method can be used where scene 2 option is pixel brt off

#Idea 004
    - New SModuleStatus for setting a module/class dynamically during run time

#Idea 007
    - Add new "WLED Animations" as led mode, or incorporate into "flasher" (do this, so mixer can be used)

#Idea 009
    - https://github.com/Aircoookie/WLED/wiki/E1.31-DMX#e131

#Idea 012
    - Add "reset user pallette" with optional selecting of copying a static palette
    
#Idea 013
    - Use flag to set that palette should random generate in pairs ie

        uint8_t colour_ids[] = {  
            pair_id1_lower, pair_id1_upper, 
            pair_id2_lower, pair_id2_upper,     
        }; 

        gives random(pair_id1_lower,pair_id1_upper) and therefore I can make random values of hue within a range, without including colour_ids
        eg greens and reds, 120:130, 0:10, ignoring 11:119

        equally, use the range of saturation AND brightness as guides for them as randoms

#Idea 014
    - make number generator, random, with skewness

#Idea 015
    - add saturation option on menu page that overrides output, as brightness does, and add optional flag to enable it/tick box

#Idea 016
    - add single pixel "flasher" animations, eg:
        - "flare" random single pixels go from current to max brightness with a short ramp up/down (<90% longer speed, >90% half speed ie iradium flare)
        - "twinkle" on off
        - "lighting" flashes of varying brightness that last a few seconds

#Idea 017
    - Create template based addlog to print any array out in a nice format, with (defaulted) option of vertical or horizontal
        AddLog_P_Arr(...., array_ptr,array_length,output_format = default_without_index, output_dir = default_horizontal)

#Idea 018
    - Specific Module Type (Car Sensor)
        - monitor 12v (7v-15v range)
        - canbus monitor
        - gps listening
        - sd card logging (logs gps values, uploading when network returns)
        - gsm network for remote checking

#Idea 019
    - webpage mixer controls will include a table/grouped mixer values that can be configured
        - flasher type (christmas animation)
        - palette 
        - duration
        - speed/rate
        - Global controls for on/off time for all mixer settings
        - add tick box options on rows (enabled, time controlled, random saturation)
        - or drop down menus (saturation as saved, random)

#Idea 020
    - Gradient rotate with "overscan" ie rainbow partial, rotate (or slider?) with inflated range (only show X% of gradient at any one time)
        - New slider animation, that moves the pixels back and forth without wraparound (this requires overscan first). ie 25-75% becomes new length, then move from 0-50 and 50-100.

#Idea 021
    - Dump as much crash data into rtcmemory before device restarts, after safe boot (10 seconds) send it via mqtt for logging. Eventually,
        send via http/ftp to a file server for logging

    sparkplugToday at 9:54 AM
    okay will try decode later, I have the hex values but I need a decoder formatted thing first with the right headers, remind me to make this automatic
    and to print via my http method now
    Can I can probe and get the exact crash log ready as a copy and paste http response, that would be awesome
    
#Idea 022
    - ADD FUNC_SENSOR_SEARCH that will search for new sensors and re-enable module if found

#Ides 023
    - Add lighting demonstration that cycles across every pattern/animation, for <user_defined> seconds each, with options to simply "end" (returning to previous resting mode) or
        stopping and using the current previewed animation as the new animation.

#Idea 024
    - Optional RGB_type as array to allow strings with different mappings to be used togehter
        [1,1,1,1,1,2,2,2] 1=RGB and 2=GRB etc 
        - probably {blocks,linear,follow_palette_style} for liveview type
        - track which pixels change user bit packed number, so I can limit webpage sending to just those

#Idea 027
    Make one group call that will append multiple responses, but also, a single call that builds using it
        - ie send palette, or, liveview, or, table, OR ALL TOGETHER

#Idea 028
    Make a class that is used to hold sensors, with ifdefs inside to give different sensor attributes (temp,pressure) ie my own "mAdafruit_Sensor.h"

#Idea 030
    Draw root "table" that includes unique names for rows and the number variable (ie send Temp/sensor name during draw and send data to that exact cell during data)

#Idea 31
    Energy Root Table will actually have its own table, drawn as rows as wide as sensors connected
                                                                                                ^^Energy^^

#Idea 32
    Add array that holds regions of temp ranges, eg
    {a,b,c,d}
    a<b = low colour
    b<c = med range
    c<d = high range
    if(climate.ptr->temperature<=25){

#Idea 34
    Add function in support that autocapitalises the first letter of any words, at the start of the string or after a space eg "this message" => "This Message"

#Idea 35
    Yes, you can do this; and for a few its fine.
    DIB = Device Independent Bitmap = RgbColor encoded data strip. One for the Start stat, One for the end state, 
    one animation channel to apply the transition. They replace the animation state that is used in the example you 
    mention. The difference is that an animation channel requires tracking information for the time/progress, if all 
    the channels are running at the same progress, then you should merge them, if you need different progress then you 
    do need separate channels.

#Idea 36
    Add/create randomness to the progress of transitioning between pixels for a glimmer effect (probably only ideal for brightness changes)
    For maybe brightness case, a fast changing (instant) randomness to brightness is better? (with a larger map applied to all other pixels)
    ie 10 pixels total, flicker 2, have the effect on overall brightness applied to the other 8

#Idea 37
    Add range where scenes can be applied, ie only use last 4 pixels  ... this is regions/segments

#Idea 39
    Add "EndOfLoop" function that allows for resseting of all module flags after they should have been handled aka "Finally"


#Idea 42
    Add additional time_on option that allows for automatic rgb leds off to be more gradual, default 1sec, optional parameter
    - Note: Make it so reseting time_on (of already set and RX new command) then do not force refresh on the leds

#Idea 43
    Add/fully support using relay driver with timed on periods that the heating can set directly eg On for X second, minutes, OR On until X time of day
    Auto Shutoff needs 
        - timelimit option (direct for lights than for heating relays)
        - set by seconds_on, minutes_on etc
        - pass DateTime (timeonly) for when it will shut off, 24 limit

#Idea 44
    Move Rate of change measurements for sensors into their own modules, but have ROC methods are extra build option for memory

#Idea 45
    Add that topbar turns red if connection of webpage has been lost, so its a js timeout

#Idea 46
    Add sizeof class to telemetry

#Idea 47
    Add version type "D0.67.0.1" as string to telemetry

#Idea 48
    additional tasker functions that allow "run once" timed events eg uptime==10s,1minute,10m,1hour 
    use to have logging greater at start, then decrease, also sleep turn on, reduce debug health/minimal rates etc

#Idea 49
    Optional extra for relay web buttons, a duplicate row for "boost" times +60,+60m, not =60, but +60, pressing
    the toggle will reset times to 0

#Idea 50
    Add flag to mqtt handler that allows overwrite and call for every mqtt to refresh once eg overwrite sendnow flag

#Idea 57
    Function that returns a number from different profiles along a progress (maybe use Ease from rgb)

#Idea 58 
    Add center text for titles of buttons/sliders (p=left, q=right, c=center)

#Idea 63
    Add effect called "flare" akin to solar flare that instead of twinkling, causes a slow ramp in brightness of random pixels with a quick burst in brightness to dim again

#Idea 64
    Add that all devices also listen to their macaddress with mqtt commands, so no matter the naming the device can still be targeted using their mac
    Also, have the device report online with IP address to this macadress topic   eg   "mac807D3A35D60D/status/LWT" -m "{LWT":"online","IP":..,"uptime":...}"

#Idea 68
    Move heating time scale into seconds, rather than minutes ...ie Set by minutes, but internal is seconds and also reports seconds

#Idea 70
    Add console on root page as option, to left/right of main div, enable/disabled with tick option to show/hide in topbar
    Use same console div name, so the same code can send it

#Idea 73
    Create buffer that will remember the last X(30?) reasons for boot using IDs and store in memory ie [hw, sw wdt etc]

#Idea 74
    Create mtime functions that take in weektime and datetime and return cstring DONE
    - use IDs to get short/long time back (datatime, TIME_SHORT_ID) DONE
    - also common names aka MM = months, ss = seconds etc hhmmssms==hour,minute,seconds,millis ie pass template which will return the correct numbers based on ascii

#Idea 75
    Create "operators" that allow me to assign datetime/weektime etc to each other and convert them

#Idea 77
    Create an 8 bit map for each GPIO pin/module which shows what a pin can/cannot do, boot limitations, change on boot etc (maybe just a documentation instead for memory reasons?)

#Idea 78
    Create command list method, the ability to pass around a command as a number_id instead of a string
    Split the parsejson_Command to actually work out the command, then call another function which handles it. This will need the ability to pass complex commands (ctr or numbers etc)
    parsejson_Command(){
        if(json.thisarg)
            Execute_Command(uint16_t command_id, T value) where T is multiple datatypes with template, using auto eg set HUE
        if(json.anotherarg)
            Execute_Command(uint16_t command_id, T value) eg set SAT            
    }
    This allows me to then call mrgb->ExecuteCommand(command_id, value) OR Execute_Command(class_id, command_id, value)

    command_id and string key for it will need pairing

#Idea 81
    Splash telemetry on boot over serial

#Idea 82
    add array to webserver that holds get states (0=do nothing, 1= fetch once, 2=fetch repeated with timer)

#Idea 83
    linked list for url fetchers? {"new_url":"erase"} 
        erase deletes
        if not found, add it with ms timer, +ve repeated, -ve once

#Idea 86
    Store uptime in memory and show in telemetry, show the LAST uptime before a reset happened ()
    
#Idea 88
    Add flag that enables/requires parsesub_scene commands to switch mode automatically, or, instead only updates values but remains in current mode
    Ie, if I set a scene colour but flasher is enabled, it can stay or automatically switch

#Idea 89
    Add checking if class pointer is not null BEFORE calling within tasker as
    prep for leaving multiple classes at built time but only create during runtime if needed
    eg ws2812 class will be on device, but only enabled (class instance) if needed

#Idea 90
    Add notification check, if the mode was on another mode, AFTER notification flash is complete then return to previous mode (eg scenes)

#Idea 91
    Send packet to LWT with uptime and useful info PRIOR to OTA start in case it fails as useful debug

#Idea 92
    rev# leaning away from this idea
    Create a short global buffer that is used when none is provided to streamline code
        if(buffer == nullptr) { global_buffer and return it for use inline}

#Idea 93
    Add another "Upsecs" aka "StableUpSeconds" which counts, but is stored in memory and is only reset on boot when reason was crash
    
#Idea 94
    Add that commands are non case senstitive, and also checked without spacing ie 
    #define D_JSON_TIMEZONE "TimeZone" possible values are:
        - "time zone"
        - "timezone" ie automatically remove all spacing

#Idea 95
    The alternative way, which I may do myself now I think about it long term, is add a argument to addlog that passes the log type "WIF" etc as an enum list, 
    thats only a single byte usage. Could probably save 4000 bytes of progmem memory, but at this point progmem is so big its just not needed.

#Idea 96
    Fix to allow progmem URLS with webserver->on(url)

#103
    Enable IP address flash over builtin led. After succesfull wifi connection flash..
    2 fast, 2 slow, 2 fast, 2 slow.... wait 5, then pulse out the IP. 
    192.168.1.123 = 1 second on then off, wait 2...    1 second flashed 2 times, wait 2
    1 second flash (2 second period = a number) and 2 second pause between numbers
    Repeat this sequence twice

#Idea 104
    Make a class wrapper that allows checks on a sensor value, setting limits and variable/static tolerances that can be checked for validity. 
    rev# - This is probably my new averaging method, I can just turn it down to size = 1 but still use rejection testing

#Idea 105
    Add into system settings page, and use the settings struct for each module and include tick boxes or number boxes to configure

#106
    Add percentage of water tank full, ie 100% full is average of all water sensors is 45 or above. 
    Shower with immersion, would look like probably 25%... while bath would be near 100%+ (map with no constrain)
    This will be some math equation, putting "probability weights" on each region, where <30 = 0% and 60deg = 100, then the 5 regions (temp sensor blocks) will be multipled
    tank_region1 = map(average(sens1,sens2),30,60,0,100)*0.2 ... tank_region2 etc
    tank_percentage = sum(tank_regions)*100

#Idea 107
    Increase transition timebase to allow for up to hour long transition (ie sunset slow turn on)

#Idea 108
    "and to have them transition from a cooler white to warmer white later in the evening" - av
    This could be like the phones, a seperate overlay on ALL effects which changes the "warmth" of colour based on TOD. ie "eye strain" or "flux"

#Idea 109
    Adding a "LinearBlend" animation that uses X pixels repeated on a string, but then blends them (e.g., 10 red, 10 green, 10 blue.... but red/green linearblend together, green/blue linearblend together)

    I might do this later as a standalone animation like the other ones
    When you think about it, red/green/blue at equal distances on the string
    linearblended completely, is... a rainbow lol
    but I mean, using the palettes to generate those colours, but then not blending completely, so it has chunks of solid colours with then blended colour too
    will look best on larger strings
    the amount of blend between pixels, I can make as a percentage ratio (100% equal full linear blend, 50% with 10 red and 10 green, only the 5 green/red nearest blend)
    by making that ratio change, as an animation, it could be a cool pulsing effect
    and then.... I could linear blend the colour as saturated.... or brightness changed too
    revision# this is an effect

#Idea 110
    Add devicename on boot message

#Idea 111
    Add array that can store the segment the pixels are from. Ie pixels = 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7 can be mapped into [0,1,2,3,0,1,2,3] that way I can set a segment (index) to be a set colour, should help with animations too. Also shelf hearts, where hearts are a different segment to the rest.
    rev# WLED does this by saving start/end pixel indexs, but I will still want (using a pointer) a hard coded way of remapping the output


#Idea 112
    Use a flag (bigpacked) for bitset to set (as a user option) which rows appear on root page for lighting (ie hide, lighting power)

#Idea 113

You see, I plan on adding log level show methods as:
- Show set and all levels above it (done)
- Show ONLY the set level (good for debugging, done)
- Use bitpacked value to turn on/off which levels to show regardless of heirachy

#Idea 114
    So rgbw addressable I will probably always require a code flash, as I need to change the animation type array
though, remind me, I could possibly do it dynamically too
For now, its so unlikely someone would be switching between both hardware its not worth my effort... yet

#Idea 115
    Add WW/CW pixel order command for output, useful when only single white channels are connected.

#Idea 116
    Disable effects which can't be displayed on hardware, and/or, do automatic switches to the equivalent eg normal blend to rgbcct_blend for h801

#Idea 117
    Adding an "exposure" type setting for the palettes. For palettes where blue/green were lowered in brightness to scale things to make reds the same brightness, have a way to push those brightness levels up

#Idea 118
    Add pixel RGB output sliders, to manually adjust red to blue shift for led hardware with apparent brightness difference 
    between channels. ie, the same as phones selecting whitepoint.
    Also, include 100+% option, to force say red of 127 in palette to be 20% more ie 120%

#Idea 119
    All sensors (most) should include optional flag to enable smoothing, where previous valid sample(s) is used to get a smoothing window

#Idea 120
  /**
   * Allow using notifications with pixel groupings, ie applying pixel notificaiton across entire strip or section with pixel_index ranges
   * 
   * */


#Idea 121
    Create a way to make animations linked by when they should change
    eg. Solar ezimuth. 

    Using a single palette of rgbcct, I can create the colour steps I want.. but how to know when to step through them aka ranges
    Stepping through may still be the best way, then the animation itself will just have a defined range where each change happens!
    This will be solar03 test 

#Idea 122
    Allow multiple animations to work at the same time, ie colour pattern and brightness pattern
    Create brightness animations that run alongside

        - brightness manual
        - brightness by sun elevation
        - brightness by time of day
        

#Idea 123 
    Create longterm sunrise style animation to be triggered at ANY time. ie, When I wake up, even if nighttime, begin a 10m sunrise wakeup brightness routine to slowly wake me up that does not
    use the elevation, but instead manually count up. It this that will later be triggered as part of an alarm (5 minute wakeup) or gradual (30 minute wakeup)

#Idea 124

Add sunelevation palette that is actually left on overnight, and is black when its nighttime

#Idea 125

    Effect animation, of mutliple group pixels that each section grows and shrinks
    ie, say 50 leds, with 5 sections with 10 leds per section
    Have the amount of leds per a section grow/shrink, with different intensities
    The effect should be "bars" of growing and shrinking colours
    Later, change the "colours in the section" to actually be palette, and hence a palette may be a single colour, or, a full rainbow
    So a solid section, could have rainbows or another palette growing into/out of it

#Idea 126

    Create option that palette values can be turned off, ie, if 5 colours existed in a palette, have the option that I can select "on/off ratio" of that palette to be returned
    So for 50%, 10 led length palette, then when showing that palette only half of them would be lit

#Idea 127
    Use "intensity" parameter as global option for all animations, with flag to set on/off
    The should enable a basic/advanced user to have basic or granular control of effects

#Idea 128 FI-128 ie FI, feature idea
    Keep detailed RTC memory inside settings, but also add a basic version to read as part of fastboot.
    Main "Setup" will have a threadsafe RTC read/write of fastboot times, and if something is wrong, use this to switch into optional boot code that
        1) Connects to default SSID "DEBUG_SSID_AP", connect to my wifi, and wait for OTA
        2) Create its own wifi, so desktop etc can connect directly (if no AP connection) so OTA can be recovered directly

 * Ideas:
 * Create two basic LCD numbers, one for outside and one for bedroom temperature
 * Create world map (like I said to jess) that lights to show where the sun is, and day/night land-mass light up with cities being bright spots.
