Different smoothing options will be investigated here.


SMA = Moving average (sum of samples divided by sample count)

EMA = Exponential moving average (faster response, places more weight on recent samples) Overdempaned

DEMA = Double Exponential Moving Average (2*EMA - EMA), faster response than EMA but may overshoot (underdepanded)
